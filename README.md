# Flask


Flask is a lightweight and versatile web framework for Python. It allows developers to build web applications quickly and with minimal boilerplate code. Flask is considered a "micro-framework," meaning it provides the core functionality needed for web development without imposing too many dependencies or constraints on the developer.

Some key features of Flask include:

* Routing: Flask provides a simple mechanism for defining URL routes and associating them with Python functions, allowing you to specify how your application responds to different HTTP requests.

* Templating: Flask includes a powerful templating engine called Jinja2, which enables developers to generate dynamic HTML content by combining static template files with dynamic data.

* HTTP Request Handling: Flask simplifies handling of HTTP requests and responses, including handling form data, cookies, file uploads, and more.

* Extension System: Flask has a rich ecosystem of extensions that add additional functionality to the framework, such as support for database integration, authentication, RESTful APIs, and more.

* Development Server: Flask comes with a built-in development server, making it easy to test and debug your applications during development.

* WSGI Compatibility: Flask is WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) compliant, allowing it to run on a variety of web servers and deployment environments.

Overall, Flask is a popular choice for building web applications in Python due to its simplicity, flexibility, and ease of use. It's particularly well-suited for small to medium-sized projects where a full-fledged framework like Django might be considered too heavy or overly opinionated.
